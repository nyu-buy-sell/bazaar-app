## Overview
### Description
An app that facilitates buying and selling items among NYU Students on the Manhattan and Brooklyn campuses. Items that can be exchanged include coursework notes, textbooks, or furniture. Special recommendation features are implemented to help users discover new items.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Shopping
- **Mobile:** This a mobile-first platform that takes advantage of the visibility the App Store offers to the iOS apps it hosts.  People can easily use their phone camera to capture images of the items they would like to sell, and buyers can instantly respond to posts and stay updated on item statuses with real-time notifications. 
- **Story:** Marketplace for buying and selling items used by students, from tables to textbooks. Sellers can list items for sale and be contacted by interested buyers on their campus. For academic-related posts, coursework tag identifiers will be assigned to sellers to match them to potential buyers that take the same classes. 
- **Market:** At launch this app will be tailored to NYU students, featuring campus and dorm-specific categorization. Future plans include expansion to other colleges.
- **Habit:** A daily or weekly brief notification will be pushed to users to inform them of newly-listed items in their followed categories. 
- **Scope:** The main item categories we will be focusing on initially is furniture and academic, each having its own dedicated section in the app. Furniture will serve as a catch-all for miscellaneous items, but over time we plan on structuring a more comprehensive categorization system that makes specific items more discoverable to potential buyers. Additionally, we plan on expanding to other colleges once we a reach a critical mass of users at NYU.
